# Kivy-Near-Earth-Object-Tracker-App
View various features of near earth objects 
that pass by the earth each day.

This Kivy app features a Spinner that lists all
the near earth objects that pass by the earth on
the given day, returning size, speed, miss
distance, etc of that object. It uses a NASA 
API to fetch the data. I have built the APK on
Google Colab for 32 bit architecture, as
indicated in the spec file. I have installed it
on my mobile and it works as it should. See 
https://api.nasa.gov/ for the API I used in this
app, as well as others.
